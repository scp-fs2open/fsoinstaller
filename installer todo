* maybe use JZLib instead of java.util.zip

* check for presence of mods by looking to see which files have been downloaded (as saved in fsoinstaller.properties)
	check saved files against files present in file system
	if saved file list isn't present, do one-time processing through mod list (peek into the zip)

* make VP extractor/builder for FSPort that copies cbanims, voice, music to tango_fs1, stu_fs1, warble_fs1 vps
	Yarn completed this, IIRC







make a new JarExtractor class to complement Downloader

change listeners & events into generic ProgressListener etc. and put them in com.fsoinstaller.common (or, meh, maybe not)
	*don't* split the extraction functionality out of Downloader (otherwise lots of large zips would be downloaded unnecessarily) but *do* make a separate JarExtractor for getting mod files out of the jar itself





add some descriptive text to say that selecting a parent won't automatically select items under it

investigate jazsync to download chunks of files instead of the entire file
	which we can't do because 7zip JBinding can only extract the entire file, not part of it

use a download bandwidth limiter?
