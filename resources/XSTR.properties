promptToDownloadNewVersion=This version of the installer is out-of-date.  Would you like to bring up the download page for the most recent version?\n\n(If you click Yes, the program will exit.)
problemDownloading=There was a problem bringing up the download link.  Try re-downloading the installer using your favorite Internet browser.
noModsFound=For some reason, there are no mods available for download.  This is not an error with the network, but rather with the remote mod repositories.\n\nThis shouldn't ever happen, and we're rather perplexed that you're seeing this right now.  We can only suggest that you try again later.\n\nClick OK to exit.
readCheckFailed=The installer could not read from the destination directory.  Please ensure that the directory is readable, or visit Hard Light Productions for technical support.

foundExtraVPs2=These are likely to cause problems, and you are encouraged to move or delete them before running the game.  Do you want to continue with the installation?

optionInstallGOG=I want to install FreeSpace 2 using the GOG setup package
optionWrongDirectory=I made a mistake; FreeSpace 2 is in a different location
optionContinueAnyway=I really do want to use this directory; let me continue at my own risk

installGOGName=Install FreeSpace 2 from GOG package
installGOGDesc=Performs a standard installation of FreeSpace 2 using the setup files provided by GOG.  When combined with FreeSpace Open, this allows you to play the game on systems that GOG does not support, such as OSX and Linux.
installOpenALName=Install OpenAL
installOpenALDesc=Runs the OpenAL installer provided by Creative Labs, which copies the OpenAL32.dll file to your system folder.  OpenAL is required for music and sound support in FreeSpace Open.\n\n(This program requires elevated privileges to run.  On Windows Vista and later versions, you will be prompted to enter your credentials.  On Windows XP and earlier, you will need to explicitly run oalinst.exe as an administrator after the FreeSpace Open Installer has exited, unless you happen to be already logged in under an administrator account.)
installPatchName=Patch FreeSpace 2 to retail version 1.20
installPatchDesc=Upgrades a version 1.01 installation of FreeSpace 2 to version 1.20.  You are likely to see version 1.01 if you install from the original retail game CDs; the Sci-Fi Sim of the Year Edition and the GOG package are version 1.20.\n\n(Note that the 1.x numbering of FreeSpace 2 installations is independent from the 3.x numbering of FreeSpace Open releases.)
installCopyCutscenesName=Copy GOG cutscenes to the data directory used by FreeSpace Open
installCopyCutscenesDesc=The GOG installation package puts the cutscenes in the "data2" and "data3" folders, which are not used by any other configuration of FreeSpace 2.  This means that FreeSpace Open will not play the cutscenes if you run it on an unmodified GOG installation.  By copying the GOG cutscenes to the standard location, FreeSpace Open will be able to find them and play them properly.
innoExtractRequiresXP=Sorry, installation using InnoExtract is only supported on Windows XP and above.  You may still install FreeSpace 2 on earlier Windows systems by using the original game CDs.  Visit Hard Light Productions for technical support.
innoExtractNotSupported=Sorry, installation using InnoExtract is not supported on your system.  Visit Hard Light Productions for technical support.
