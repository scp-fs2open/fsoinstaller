OpenAL is required for music and sound support in FreeSpace Open.\n\n(This program requires elevated privileges to run.

copyInstallationName=Copy FreeSpace 2 from existing installation
copyInstallationDesc=Copies an installation of FreeSpace 2 from one directory to another.  This is recommended for Steam users because the default Steam installation directory can cause problems due to long path names, spaces in the path, and permissions settings in the path folders.  The recommended location for FreeSpace 2 is something like C\:\\Games\\FreeSpace2, which avoids all three of those problems.

You are likely to see version 1.01 if you install from the original retail game CDs; the Sci-Fi Sim of the Year Edition, the GOG package, and the Steam package are version 1.20.\n\n(Note that the 1.x numbering of FreeSpace 2 installations is independent from the 3.x numbering of FreeSpace Open releases.)
installCopyCutscenesName=Copy GOG cutscenes to the data directory used by FreeSpace Open
installCopyCutscenesDesc=The GOG installation package puts the cutscenes in the "data2" and "data3" folders, which are not used by any other configuration of FreeSpace 2.  This means that FreeSpace Open will not play the cutscenes if you run it on an unmodified GOG installation.  By copying the GOG cutscenes to the standard location, FreeSpace Open will be able to find them and play them properly.
